# EmbeddingShift.NET

A .NET 8 based toolkit for working with vector embeddings and adaptive shift strategies.  
It provides infrastructure for ingest, simulation, storage, and adaptive controllers.

---

## Features
- **Embedding Shift**  apply and evaluate different shift strategies on vector spaces  
- **Simulation**  run tests without external API dependencies  
- **Storage Layer**  persist embeddings and shifts with database abstractions  
- **Adaptive Controller**  dynamically adjust and evaluate shifts  

---

## Tech Stack
- C# / .NET 8  
- Visual Studio 2022  
- GitHub Actions (optional for CI/CD)

## Project Structure
- src/  Solution and code (Core, Adaptive, Simulation, Storage, Abstractions)  
- scripts/  PowerShell helper scripts  
- data/  input data  
- esults/  test outputs

## Note
This repository is part of my **RakeX** project (Rapid AI Knowledge Exchange).  
Internally I use *RakeX* as umbrella name  here the focus is on the embedding & shift component.
